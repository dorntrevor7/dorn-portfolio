            <h3 class="abtH3">Who is Trev?</h3>
            <p class="abtP">Since my Father passed away in 2018 my mind hasn't been able to let me sit still. Going
                through my first
                year
                in college, getting good grades (A’s and B’s), while working in customer service as a service lot
                attendant,
                searching for “more”. So, I moved into my own place and started playing baseball at GCC, when the urge
                to be
                heroic came upon me. It was then, I felt I had to support my family, in every aspect, but financially
                the
                most. So, I decided to get my Full-Stack Development Certificate from the University of Arizona to enter
                the
                tech world. Shortly after, I was introduced to door to door sales and I loved the basics of it- the
                mechanics. I loved feeling driven again. So I moved to Minnesota and sold pest control. After the
                summer, I
                moved back to Arizona to sell life insurance but after the second sale I soon realized it wasn’t me
                racing
                to provide for my family, but rather it was my mind racing and I couldn’t catch up to it. It was then I
                found the answer I didn't know I was searching for. So once I knew that, I was able to calm my mind and
                reach a place of steadiness. I could start building a foundation capable of fruition. But more
                importantly,
                I was able to be present and be in the moment with my family, friends, and colleagues- the truest form
                of
                providence. I lost a lot when I lost my Father but what I lost in guidance I gained in golden nuggets
                here
                and there. Tips and tricks on how to deal with stress, responsibility, and maturity. That explains the
                job
                history and education, I hope to hear from you soon and thank you for your time in reviewing this.</p>
